# Jobsity Calendar

The app was designed using React Hooks to handle the state and it not connected to a back-end server or database. All information entered in the calendar is volatile and will disappear upon page reload.  
The following libraries were used during development:  
● React Bootstrap (Minor UI components)
● React Hook Forms (Form handling)  
● React Datepicker (Datepicker controls)  
● Modali (Modal management)  
● date-fns (Date management)  
● React Open Weather (Weather forecasrting)  
Weather information is provided by the OpenWeather API.

## Features

All basic functionality was achieved, the following bonus features are included:  
● Calendar expansion (the calendar can correctly display any month/year combination)  
● Reminder deletion

<!--● Daily reminders deletion
● Reminder overflow in a single day -->

## Original Assignment

### Description

This project is designed to test your knowledge of front-end web technologies and assess your
ability to create front-end UI products with attention to details, cross-browser compatibility,
standards, and reusability.

### Assignment

The goal of this exercise is to create a demo calendar application using React, Vue or Angular.
You should start by rendering a single month view of a calendar for the current month.

### Mandatory Features

● Ability to add a new "reminder" (max 30 chars) for a user entered day and time. Also,
include a city.  
● Display reminders on the calendar view in the correct time order.  
● Allow the user to select color when creating a reminder and display it appropriately.  
● Ability to edit reminders – including changing text, city, day, time and color.  
● Add a weather service call from a free API such as Open Weather Map, and get the
weather forecast (ex. Rain) for the date of the calendar reminder based on the city.  
● Unit test the functionality: Ability to add a new "reminder" (max 30 chars) for a user
entered day and time. Also, include a city.

### Bonus (Optional)

● Expand the calendar to support more than the current month.  
● Properly handle overflow when multiple reminders appear on the same date.  
● Functionality to delete one or ALL the reminders for a specific day

### Considerations

● Redux (or any other state manager) structure of the calendar.  
● The project is totally focused on the front-end; please ignore the back-end.  
● Keep your code versioned with Git.  
● Feel free to use small helper libraries for:  
○ UI Elements.  
○ Date/Time handling.

### Deliverables

When you finish the assignment, send a zip file (don’t forget to include the .git/ folder.) or upload
your project to your Git repo (Github, BitBucket, etc...) and share the repository link with your
initial contact via email. Indicate which, if any, of the bonus tasks you completed.
